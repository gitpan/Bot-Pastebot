    Allow each bot module to configure itself. The main program collects
    configuration info from each module, then passes it to the Conf
    module. I've also added _class info to the configurations. I'm
    considering making each bot module its own object and having the Conf
    module instantiate them directly.

    Grab the CHANGES from an explicit repository path since "svn info"
    doesn't work from svk.

    Move the initialization code from the main execution path to
    initialize() class methods. Call them from pastebot. Added a simple
    use_ok() test for all the modules, made possible because stuff
    doesn't immediately start up when classes are loaded now.

    Cleaned up "make dist" somewhat. Still needs to build the snapshot

    Cleaned up "make install" somewhat. Removed the need for a separate
    pasetbot.lib.sample file. It's generated by Makefile now. 

  2004-09-08 15:10:40 (r88) by rcaputo; README M; Makefile M

    Removed the bogus "&& \" from the makefile. I'm not sure whether
    that's just extra text or whether it indicates a missing command,
    though. More debugging is needed there.
    
    I fixed the install paths. Pastebot now installs in /usr/local/...
    rather than /usr/... It seemed more reasonable that way.
    
    The README is slightly updated. 

  2004-09-03 03:17:42 (r87) by rcaputo; Makefile M

    Removed an errant "&& \" from the end of one of the install
    directives. Thanks to buu for actually using the makefile and
    discovering the problem. It's kinda sad that he's a whiner, with such
    amazing initial feedback as "Someone fix pastebot =[". Luckily he
    responds with details when pressed, or this would probably never have
    been fixed. So in the end, go, buu!

    Indigoid runs Memephage in a channel with a lot of color codes flying

    because of colorization attached to them, so he wrote a few regular

    code.

    Clean up the missing modules error message, so it reports the actual

  2004-04-27 05:42:19 (r83) by tonycoz; pastebot.conf-dist M

  Makefile M; Util/Conf.pm M; README M; Util/Data.pm M; pastebot.perl M

    Applied a modified version of Jari Aalto's patch to support sitewide
    installation through revised configuration and library placement.
    
    He added Makefile targets for a standard installation. The README now
    includes instructions for using the new makefile targets. Util::Conf
    supports finding configuration files in standard locations.
    Util::Data accepts the persistent paste storage location from a
    configuration file. The local library directory is searched for at
    startup time rather than being hardcoded.

  2003-12-22 06:38:42 (r79) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M; Client/IRC.pm M

    Applied Jeremy Mates' patches. They add more robust URL handling,
    better X-Forwarded-For support, line counts to the on-channel
    announcement, and cleaner channel list building code. 

  2003-12-22 05:29:14 (r78) by rcaputo; README M

    Apply Jeremy Mates' documentation patches. He expanded upon the

    Matthijs van Duin (efnet, CPAN "xmath") insisted that the HTML
    responses aren't compliant with w3c's HTML 4.01 specification without
    including a character encoding. He STRONGLY insisted that some form
    of encoding be specified.
    
    | <xmath> [character encoding is] not "advisory".. without it [the |
    HTML] is not valid
    
    He provided the patch that I am applying with this commit. By
    applying this patch, I have disregarded the objections of Juerd and
    Yaakov:
    
    | <Yaakov> The ecoding type is NOT part of the HTML in that document,
    | it is a server issue. | <xmath> that's why you should specify it in
    the header | <xmath> Yaakov: if you just specify it on both the form
    page and the | result page, then at least people can enter extended
    chars | without worrying about them getting messed up | | <xmath>
    Juerd: I'm not sure all browsers can properly deal with | utf-8 |
    <xmath> though I guess modern ones do | <Juerd> xmath: Most modern
    browsers | <Juerd> xmath: But most ANY browsers guess charsets, and
    they're | rather good at that | <xmath> Juerd: yes, because there are
    so many broken pages | <Yaakov> Yes... I think that was my point. I
    don't know what will | be pasted. | | <xmath> if you want to rely on
    guessing | <xmath> fine | <xmath> but then don't put up a "Valid HTML
    4.01" logo | <xmath> because it isn't | <xmath> anyway, dinner time |
    <xmath> bbl | | <Juerd> xmath: HTML 4.01 has nothing to do with the
    charset | <Yaakov> THAT IS MY POINT | <Yaakov> The HTML _IS_ VALID
    
    I will be happy to reverse this patch if it breaks more than it
    fixes.

    Nick tracking, rotation, reclamation was not keeping track of the
    bot's current nickname properly. This change gets it working well
    enough to build the channel list, anyway. It's untested for actual
    nick rotation/reclamation on clashes, however. I'm pressed for time
    to do this more right than absolutely necessary right now. 

  2003-11-13 03:41:49 (r68) by rcaputo; Util/Data.pm M; Client/IRC.pm M

    TonyC noticed that the dynamic channel listing was broken. It didn't
    list anything until the bot side was kicked and invited back, and
    then it only listed the channel it was re-invited to. This patch
    reworks the channel management functions in Util::Data and also
    disambiguates lc() calls in Client::IRC.
    
    Actually, it seems that a previous patch removed irc_join. We put it
    back as well.

    Add support for nonstandard server ports. Thanks to Chris Ellsworth
    for requesting it, or you'd still be waiting for it. :) Just throw a
    port number on the server lines in pastebot.conf, separated from the
    server host by spaces and/or colons, and you're good to go. The

    Woops. Forgot some things wrt snapshot building. 

  2003-10-31 16:35:13 (r57) by rcaputo; README M; Util/Data.pm M; TODO M

    Apply Averell's persistent database patch. Remove the persistent
    paste and ignores stores from the todo list. Update the README to
    include Storable as a new dependency (although it comes with modern
    Perl).

  Server/Web.pm M; templates/paste-form.html M;
  templates/paste-lookup.html M

    Allow the bot itself to serve small files. Alter Yaakov's new
    templates so the image links point into the bot. Now they're totally
    self-contained. 

  2003-10-30 17:37:13 (r55) by rcaputo; TODO M

    Log Yaakov's ideas for posterity. They need to be assimilated into
    the overall todo file structure. Quite likely the entire file should
    be redone in outline form. 

  2003-10-30 17:14:10 (r54) by rcaputo; data/nopaste.gif A; data A

    Added Yaakov's wonderful logo. 

  2003-10-30 17:12:53 (r53) by rcaputo
  templates/paste-form.html M; templates/paste-lookup.html M

    Apply Yaakov's stylish templates over the dreary ones we used to
    have. 

  2003-07-06 18:57:57 (r52) by rcaputo; TODO M

    Note that the bot should daemonize itself.

  Server/Web.pm M; Util/Data.pm M; Client/IRC.pm M

    Added dynamic channel management. Pastes can now only go to joined
    channels.
    
    Util::Data::channels()

    returns wantarray ? channel names : number of channels
    
    Util::Data::clear_channels()

    returns success ? true : false
    
    Util::Data::add_channel($channel)

    returns success ? new number of channels : false
    
    Util::Data::remove_channel($channel)

    returns success ? number of removed channels (should be 1) : false
    
    Removed my_chans in Client::IRC. channels() should be used now.
    
    Updated error message when pasting to unknown channel. Channel may be
    known ($ircconf{channel}), but not joined (channels()).

  README M; TODO M; pastebot.conf-dist M

    Make minor tweaks and add TODO tasks based on Nicholas Schuetz's
    feedback. 

  2003-06-08 16:10:56 (r49) by rcaputo; Util/Conf.pm M; Server/Web.pm M

    Justin Mitchell reported that the bot would crash if it was assigned
    no channels to listen on. This change fixes that and some collateral
    warnings. 

  2003-06-08 15:53:46 (r48) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    Applied Jeremy Mates' patch to fix /paste through port-80 proxies.
    Also the patch to fix selected channels. 

  2003-06-04 04:08:11 (r47) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    Applied Jeremy Mates' proxypass patch. Also his more forgiving URL
    format patch. Also his proxypass support patches. Also his patch to
    serve a text/plain MIME type on plaintext output. Also his patch for
    proper 404 content.
    
    Added preliminary support for wrapped (non-pre formatted) text. 

  2003-06-04 04:06:03 (r46) by rcaputo; Util/Web.pm M

    Replace our buggy, homegrown (and very old, stale) template engine
    with Text::Template. 

  2003-06-04 04:05:18 (r45) by rcaputo; templates/paste-lookup.html M

    Add the "wrap" (no pre tag) checkbox to drive the internal formatting
    change. 

  2003-06-04 04:04:37 (r44) by rcaputo; Util/Conf.pm M

    Apply Jeremy Mates' patch to support Apache proxypass better. 

  2003-06-04 04:04:10 (r43) by rcaputo; pastebot.conf-dist M

    Apply Jeremy Mates' patch for a new option to support proxypass in
    Apache. 

  2003-06-04 03:24:43 (r42) by rcaputo; README M

    Document the new Text::Template requirement. Applied Jeremy Mates'
    doc patch for proper ProxyPass use in Apache. 

  2003-06-04 03:23:24 (r41) by rcaputo
  templates/paste-form.html M; templates/paste-lookup.html M;
  templates/paste-answer.html M

    Updated the templates to use Text::Template syntax. 

  2003-02-03 04:50:49 (r40) by rcaputo; README M

    Added a note about missing prerequisite module errors, thanks to
    Hellaenergy. 

  2003-02-03 04:50:17 (r39) by rcaputo; pastebot.perl M

    Nicholas Schuetz (Hellaenergy) suggested that pastebot look in the
    current working directory for its libraries. This patch adds '.' to
    @INC. 

  2002-11-27 08:42:51 (r38) by rcaputo
  templates/paste-form.html M; pastebot.conf-dist M

    Make the network someone pastes to a little more prominent. This is
    in response to people pasting to the wrong network of a multi-net
    bot. 

  2002-11-03 22:23:13 (r37) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    Wrap the $summary in quotes on the IRC announcement. 

  2002-10-18 02:44:48 (r36) by rcaputo; Client/IRC.pm M

    Add an uptime command so we can have high-precision happiness about
    how long the bot runs. 

  2002-10-18 02:42:34 (r35) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    I forgot to wrap one of the Perl::Tidy invocations in eval{}. Make
    sure they're both done now, and replace the tidied content with $@ if
    there's been an error. 

  2002-10-18 02:10:17 (r34) by rcaputo
  templates/paste-form.html M; templates/highlights.css M;
  templates/paste-lookup.html M

    Trivial whitespace cleanup in highlights.css. Make the style sheet
    hrefs relative instead of absolute. Make the form actions relative
    instead of absolute. These should fix problems with using the web
    services through ProxyPass directives. 

  2002-10-18 02:02:30 (r33) by tonycoz
  Util/Conf.pm M; Server/Web.pm M; pastebot.conf-dist M

    add an option to see if there's a proxy, if the request came through
    the passthrough proxy, extract the originating IP address from the
    headers the proxy gives us. 

  2002-10-17 03:19:48 (r32) by tonycoz
  Makefile A; MANIFEST A; MANIFEST.SKIP A

    Added a makefile and manifest to make it simpler to build
    distributions. 

  2002-10-17 02:51:49 (r31) by tonycoz; Server/Web.pm M

    We were sending the summary HTML encoded to IRC 

  2002-10-16 16:16:22 (r30) by rcaputo; CHANGES D

    Remove CHANGES as it will be dynamically generated. 

  2002-10-15 22:14:02 (r29) by rcaputo; templates/paste-form.html M

    Included yossarian's jscript code to fill the paste textarea from the
    clipboard. This only works on IE, though. 

  2002-10-15 22:12:34 (r28) by rcaputo; Util/Conf.pm M; Util/Data.pm M

    Applied Jonathan Scott Duff's patches to periodically expire old
    pastes or force expiration of the oldest pastes when new ones would
    overflow some limit. These patches constrain the bot's memory
    footprint. 

  2002-10-15 22:10:55 (r27) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    Patched a security hole yossarian found. It is possible in previous
    versions to make the bot send arbitrary IRC commands. 

  2002-10-15 22:09:24 (r26) by rcaputo; Client/IRC.pm M

    Insignificant tweak to the debugging output. 

  2002-10-15 22:08:25 (r25) by rcaputo; pastebot.conf-dist M

    Apply Jonathan Scott Duff's configuration changes to specify the
    maximum number of pastes to keep and the maximum paste lifetime. 

  2002-07-23 22:04:15 (r23) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M; CHANGES M

    Made (none) the default channel so that morons who don't read the
    instructions don't spam some innocent channel with paste notices. 

  2002-06-25 14:49:47 (r22) by rcaputo; README M

    Pastebot is hostile towards people behind firewalls. It runs a
    separate server which often must not be on port 80 (because some
    other web server is there). Added notes for Apache's ProxyPass
    directive, so a port-80 server can forward requests to pastebot. 

  2002-06-08 18:23:28 (r21) by rcaputo; CHANGES M

    Tidy CHANGES for another release. 

  2002-06-08 18:17:57 (r20) by rcaputo; Util/Web.pm M

    Added an is_true() function to reduce many different forms of truth
    and falsity into 1 and 0 so perl can understand them. 

  2002-06-08 18:16:48 (r19) by rcaputo
  Server/Web.pm M; templates/paste-lookup.html M

    Added an option to render pasted text as text/plain without any
    adornments. This will let people fetch things like diffs with wget,
    and they should appear without whitespace munging that many browsers
    perpetrate during copy and paste. 

  2002-06-08 18:14:50 (r18) by rcaputo; TODO M; CHANGES M

    Documented changes and suggestions via IRC. 

  2002-05-21 13:10:03 (r17) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M; CHANGES M

    Kane discovered that MSIE does not treat <br> as a newline when
    copying text with <pre></pre>. Anything copied from pastebot was
    being put on the clipboard as one long line. <br> isn't needed within
    <pre></pre> anyway, so I removed the code to replace newlines with
    them. I also verified that &nbsp; isn't needed in preformatted text
    and removed the code to translate spaces into them. That'll save some
    bandwidth, too. 

  2002-05-18 00:59:02 (r16) by rcaputo; README M; TODO M; CHANGES M

    Document changes in a user-friendly fashion.
    
    Add Perl::Tidy to the list of dependencies in README.
    
    Remove done things from TODO. 

  2002-05-18 00:54:39 (r15) by rcaputo; Server/Web.pm M

    Replace the static content with templates.
    
    Implement better parameters for paste lookup, and a control panel of
    sorts to twiddle them.
    
    Add Perl::Tidy support for source beautification and highlighting.
    
    Put in a little footer that advertises the bot and POE. :) 

  2002-05-18 00:53:09 (r14) by rcaputo; Util/Web.pm M

    Prepare the templating code for use. It was kind of old. 

  2002-05-18 00:52:26 (r13) by rcaputo; pastebot.perl M

    Remove old comments.

  templates A; templates/paste-form.html A; templates/highlights.css A;
  templates/paste-lookup.html A; templates/paste-answer.html A

    Create templates for a large amount of the web interface's static
    content. Create a style sheet that defines how Perl source is
    highlighted. 

  2002-05-16 04:45:04 (r11) by tonycoz; TODO M

    TonyC suggested renaming pastebot.conf to pastebot.conf-dist, so it
    won't clobber deveopers' and users' customized pastebot.conf files.
    It was a good idea, and now it's implemented. 

  2002-05-08 20:14:36 (r9) by rcaputo; pastebot.conf M; CHANGES M

    Tidy up some host names in the configuration file. 

  2002-05-08 16:19:59 (r8) by rcaputo; README M
